   Once I was seven years old my momma told me.
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely.
Once I was seven years old
   It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger.
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker.
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor.
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure.
Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me.
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely.
Once I was eleven years old.
   I always had that dream like my daddy before me.
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories.
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me.
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me.
